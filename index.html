          <p class="aboutSecton" >Students are disatified with the lack of resources and opportunities for learning. This website is a place
            where teachers can learn about how to improve their students' education. Pupils can also learn about the
            benefits of learning in school and how to make a difference in their school's education. Parents need to
            priortize their children's education so they can get the best learning resources to offer. As the world
            keeps evolving, there are more branching ways to develop an education through different technologies. The
            COVID-19 pandemic brought students to learn through online communication and completing assignments from the
            comfort of your own home. However, the current system of education is not the best for pupils, resulting in
            higher chances of cheating and lack of motivation. </p>

                <p>Visualize of the different problems of the current education system. Think of possible ways where we
                  can improve our current way of schooling, so students of the next generation don't have to go through
                  the same problems we're going through today. Future generations are going to experience our style of
                  learning, so as students, educators, and former students, we have an obligation to play a part in the
                  future of education. One voice is nothing, but a million is more than enough
                  to make a difference. </p>
